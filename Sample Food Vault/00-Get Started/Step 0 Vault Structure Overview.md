>Next: [[Step 1 Create Your First Ingredient]]
### Intro
- 5 plugins are being used in this vault: 
	- `Templater` and `Dataview` for the functional part, 
	- `Emoji Shortcodes` and `Advanced Table` are for the aesthetic look, 
	- and `Hotkeys for Specific Files` is for navigating back to [[Homepage]].

### Folder Structure
>It is quite self-explanatory, is it not?
- `00-Get Started` stores all the tutorial markdown files.
- `99-Templates` stores all the templates, I separate the function part and the template part because I forget how to do them together in a single file...
- `98-All the Food` stores ingredients and recipes. [[All the Food]] will present all of them in a dataview query. 
- `02-Daily Note` is for daily notes.
