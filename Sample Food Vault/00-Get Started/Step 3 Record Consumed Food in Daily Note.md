[[Function - Add Food Record for Today's Daily Note]] assists you:
- *freely* add food you have eaten; By that, I mean it does not matter which file you are at, it will auto add food record into your **Today's** Daily Note.
	- **Mobile Issue**: If you are at Today's Daily Note with **Reading View**, [[Function - Add Food Record for Today's Daily Note]] will not work. You need to switch to editing mode and I don't know exactly why.
- store nutrition values in properties
	- P.S.: Number of calories will be stored in unit of `kCal` 
	- Unless you open the callout in reading view, properties will not update. This is intentional since too many dataviewjs in a vault will affect performance.
